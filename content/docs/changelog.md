## Notes on Compatibility

Since this application only operates on top of the `nordvpn` command line app,
there are some requirements when it comes to compatibility.

> Recommended minimum version: `v3.7` (NordVPN) for `v1.0` (NordVPN GUI).

Why?
- Is the version, this app started to be developed with.
- New command `nordvpn set defaults` required.
- No mayor changes in the CLI since then (as of `v3.8.10`).

Older versions are not tested and therefore not guaranteed to be working.
